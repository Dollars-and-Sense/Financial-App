# Financial App

## Setup

Use NodeJS 16.20.2. (We recommend using `nvm` to manage multiple NodeJS versions.)

To install packages, we currently need to use `--legacy-peer-deps` due to conflicts.

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

The frontend app expects the [the backend](https://github.com/Dollars-and-Sense/finapp-API) to be running as well as MongoDB. Once those are up and running, do the following:

```
npm start
```
